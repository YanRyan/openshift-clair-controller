The nss-util packages provide utilities for use with the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: nss (3.21.3), nss-util (3.21.3). Security Fix(es): * Multiple buffer handling flaws were found in the way NSS handled cryptographic data from the network. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash an application using NSS or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-2834) * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way NSS handled invalid Diffie-Hellman keys. A remote client could use this flaw to crash a TLS/SSL server using NSS. (CVE-2016-5285) * It was found that Diffie Hellman Client key exchange handling in NSS was vulnerable to small subgroup confinement attack. An attacker could use this flaw to recover private keys by confining the client DH key to small subgroup of the desired group. (CVE-2016-8635) Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting CVE-2016-2834. The CVE-2016-8635 issue was discovered by Hubert Kario (Red Hat).

(CVE-2017-7502) Bug Fix(es): * The Network Security Services (NSS) code and Certificate Authority (CA) list have been updated to meet the recommendations as published with the latest Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR). The updated CA list improves compatibility with the certificates that are used in the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). To avoid certificate validation refusals, Red Hat recommends installing the updated CA list on June 12, 2017. (BZ#1451421)",
